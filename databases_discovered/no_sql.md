## What is a noSQL Database?
Simply put, a noSQL database is a nonrelational database. In contrast to [relational databases](https://github.com/zthewriter/path_to_technical_writer/blob/master/databases_discovered/databases.md), nonrelational databases do not rely on a table structure to input, organize, and relate data. For this reason, noSQL (nonrelational) databases are known to be more flexible and the preferred option for unstructured, or slightly structured, data.

Note: Recall that SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
