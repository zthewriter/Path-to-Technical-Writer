# path_to_technical_writer
This is my first repository (nice to meet you GitHub)! In this repository I plan on sharing my discoveries, via simple documentation, as I learn more about JavaScript, the Cloud, and Databases. Cheers to the thoughtful investigations ahead! 

This repository will explore **database, cloud, and coding activities**. Included with each activity will be an accompanying technical document detailing discoveries.
