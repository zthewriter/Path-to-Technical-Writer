I've always been a writer of sorts. I write tech specs, creative stories, financial bits of wisdom -  the list goes on and on! 

BUT,  writing **technical documentation** has recently caught my attention. The opportunity to apply _both_ my creative and technical skills excites me!    

This may be my first time using Markdown, but I know I am in love. <img src="https://creazilla-store.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/emojis/47096/smiling-face-with-heart-eyes-emoji-clipart-md.png" src="https://creazilla-store.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/emojis/47096/smiling-face-with-heart-eyes-emoji-clipart-md.png" width="20" length="20" />

NOTE: It took me the majority of my day to get here, but I am so glad I made it!

My hope is to use this repository to keep track of my notes and learning as I make my dream of becoming a Technical writer come true.
