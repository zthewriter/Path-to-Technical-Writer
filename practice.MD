## Starting the Technical Writer Journey

Hi, I'm Z.

I am the creator of [**zwrites.com**](zwrites.com). 
I started this repository to keep myself accountable in making a dream I have come true. This dream is to be a Technical Writer, and with both hardwork and dedication I plan to make this dream a reality.   

I've always been a writer of sorts. I write tech specs, creative stories, financial bits of wisdom -  the list goes on and on! 

BUT,  writing **technical documentation** has recently caught my attention. The opportunity to apply _both_ my creative and technical skills excites me!    

This may be my first time using Markdown, but I know I am in love. <img src="https://creazilla-store.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/emojis/47096/smiling-face-with-heart-eyes-emoji-clipart-md.png" src="https://creazilla-store.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/emojis/47096/smiling-face-with-heart-eyes-emoji-clipart-md.png" width="20" length="20" />

NOTE: It took me the majority of my day to get here,
but I am so glad I made it! 
```

My hope is to use this repository to keep track of my notes and learning as I make my dream of becoming a Technical writer come true.

NOTE: Comments and feedback always welcome. 
Feel free to reference, add to, and comment 
on this repository as material is added.

Cheers,

Z the writer
