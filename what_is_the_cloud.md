## What is the Cloud?

#### Introduction: 
This document will discuss what the Cloud is at its most basic level. We will explore formal definitions, common uses, and extended uses of the Cloud. Please note this document is intended as a beginner's introduction to the Cloud, and assumes a non-technical audience.   

### What is the Cloud? 
```
FUN FACT: You already use the cloud! 
```
One of the most common uses of the Cloud is **Cloud Storage**. Cloud Storage is used on a variety of everyday consumer products such as computers, tablets, and cell phones. A tangible example of Cloud Storage is **iCloud**, Apple's consumer Cloud solution. iCloud stores photos, contact information, application information, and much more for the user. One of the greatest benefits of iCloud is a user's ability to transfer information from one device to another easily. iCloud stores a user's information separate from their device. User information such as liked songs, downloaded applications, and saved contacts is not stored locally on the device, yet rather **externally**. This external environment is known as the Cloud.     

**NOTE:** The following formal definition of the Cloud is available on the Internet. Simply click on the link after the definition to read more. 

**Formal definition:**  

"Simply put, the cloud is the Internetâ€”more specifically, it's all of the things you can access remotely over the Internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on Internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive."

The above definition simply defines what the Cloud is as a follow up to our earlier example of iCloud. The key word in this definition is **remote**. But, where is this remote **Internet server** that stores all of this information? Based on which company you subscribe to for Cloud Storage services, your data can be stored in servers located in any part of the world. That is where the information is stored and made accessible to you via the Internet. 

### What is Cloud Computing? 

**NOTE:** The following formal definition of the Cloud is available on the Internet. Simply click on the link after the definition to read more. 

"Cloud computing refers to Internet-based provision of storage, computing power, or application software as a service. Basically, these infrastructures are used via programs installed on the accessing devices (clients) or web browsers. The underlying architecture is maintained by the service provider."

The above definition of **Cloud Computing** includes a very important key phrase, software as a service. In addition to offering storgae solutions, the Cloud also offers a variety of other services for users. These services can be used by consumers or businesses. An example of a Cloud Computing service is **DevOps**. DevOps is a tool that allows software developers programming in different languages to not only avoid "merge hell", but also utilize continuous integration and continuous deployment. Simply put, this service makes the daily tasks of software developers much easier, especially when there are multiple people working on a team. This is an example of how a Cloud service can offer more than a storage solution. Also, it is important to note that this Cloud service is offered by a variety of companies within the Cloud Industry such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service, and Google Cloud Platform.     

### Conclusion 

Overall, the Cloud can be thought of as a service that exists externally of your device and is accessible via the Internet. It offers services that are familiar to both consumers and businesses. On a final note, the Cloud is not a cloud in the sky, yet rather a server physically somewhere in this world that is holding your information for you until you are ready to access it.
